## My Dataset - UKgas
UKgas

plot(UKgas)
Acf(UKgas)
## Acf plot shows both downward trend and seasonality presense here.

fit3 <- auto.arima(UKgas,trace=TRUE, stepwise = FALSE )
fit3
ndiffs(UKgas)
ndiffs((diff(UKgas,4)))
## We got ndiffs as 1 now
tsdisplay(diff(UKgas,4))
arima_fit <- auto.arima(UKgas,trace=TRUE, stepwise = FALSE )
arima_fit

## Best Model as per ARIMA is, (3,1,1)(0,1,1)[4]
## AIC value is 1024.84 which is the lowest for the above mentioned best model.

attributes(arima_fit)
plot(forecast(arima_fit,h=5,level=c(99.5)), main = 'Forecast of the ARIMA model', xlab = 'Year', ylab = 'Expenditure')
Acf(arima_fit$residuals)
## All the ponts lie inbetween the confidence interval only.
## Hence, this can be considered the best forecast for the data.
Box.test(residuals(arima_fit), lag=20, type="Ljung")

## The p-value is greater than 0.05 which shows the null hypothesis is supported.
## Also, the residuals are random here.
plot.ts(residuals(arima_fit))
hist(arima_fit$residuals)
## The histogram shows that the residuals have a mean of zero.

tsdiag(arima_fit)
##  The basic residual plot looks normal. Two residuals are very nearer to touch the z-score of 2 but did not touch the line.
## No significant values are present in the Acf plot.
## This proves that the ARIMA model is the best fit forecast for the data set UKgas.
